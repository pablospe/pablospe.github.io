Current localization systems rely on the persistent storage of 3D point clouds of the scene to enable camera pose estimation, but such data reveals potentially sensitive scene information. This gives rise to significant privacy risks, especially as for many applications 3D mapping is a background process that the user might not be fully aware of. We pose the following question: How can we avoid disclosing confidential information about the captured 3D scene, and yet allow reliable camera pose estimation? This paper proposes the first solution to what we call privacy preserving image-based localization. The key idea of our approach is to lift the map representation from a 3D point cloud to a 3D line cloud. This novel representation obfuscates the underlying scene geometry while providing sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments on several datasets and localization scenarios underline the high practical relevance of our proposed approach.","tags":["Privacy Preserving","3D Reconstruction","PhD"],"title":"Privacy Preserving Image-Based Localization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Speciale","Danda P.

We approximate semantic regions by ellipsoids, and leverage their convexity to formulate the correspondence search effectively as a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the number of matched regions, and which we solve globally optimal in a Branch-and-Bound fashion. To this end, we derive suitable linear matrix inequality constraints which describe ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid assignment conditions. Our approach is robust to large percentages of outliers and thus applicable to difficult correspondence search problems. In multiple experiments we demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of our approach on a number of challenging vision problems.","tags":["Optimization","3D Reconstruction","PhD"],"title":"Consensus Maximization for Semantic Region Correspondences","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"998e98d728281dc7dbc211eca3dc4d91","permalink":"https://speciale.com.ar/project/security/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/security/","section":"project","summary":"  ","tags":["Privacy Preserving"],"title":"Privacy","type":"project"},{"authors":["Pablo Speciale","Danda P.

Missing color and depth information due to incomplete input or disocclusions is efficiently inpainted in a temporally consistent way. The inpainting takes the location of strong image gradients into account as likely depth discontinuities. We present our method in the context of a view correction system for mobile devices, and discuss how to obtain a screen-camera calibration and options for acquiring depth input. Our method has use cases in both augmented and virtual reality applications.

We detect symmetries from incomplete data while explicitly handling unexplored areas to allow for plausible scene completions. The set of detected symmetries is then enforced on their respective support domain within a variational reconstruction framework. This formulation also handles multiple symmetries sharing the same support. The proposed approach is able to denoise and complete surface geometry and even hallucinate large scene parts. We demonstrate in several experiments the benefit of harnessing symmetries when regularizing a surface.","tags":["3D Reconstruction","PhD"],"title":"A Symmetry Prior for Convex Variational 3D Reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Cohen","Johannes L.

However, reconstructing the inside and the outside of a building into a single model is very challenging due to the lack of visual overlap and the change of lighting conditions between the two scenes. We propose a solution to align disconnected indoor and outdoor models of the same building into a single 3D model. Our approach leverages semantic information, specifically window detections, in multiple scenes to obtain candidate matches from which an alignment hypothesis can be computed. To determine the best alignment, we propose a novel cost function that takes both the number of window matches and the intersection of the aligned models into account. We evaluate our solution on multiple challenging datasets.","tags":["3D Reconstruction","PhD"],"title":"Indoor-Outdoor 3D Reconstruction Alignment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"b493ece0d9adaf31fc2417bc1a181bff","permalink":"https://speciale.com.ar/project/optimization/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/optimization/","section":"project","summary":"  ","tags":["Optimization"],"title":"Optimization","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1448924400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448924400,"objectID":"49c1b07737f390e841f71f75449e419e","permalink":"https://speciale.com.ar/project/sfm/","publishdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sfm/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["sfm"],"title":"sfm","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kalin Kolev","Petri Tanskanen","Pablo Speciale","Marc Pollefeys"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1404165600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404165600,"objectID":"6877473334fa8aa55230d0693e0feb00","permalink":"https://speciale.com.ar/publication/eth_mobile/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eth_mobile/","section":"publication","summary":"Allows users to build interactively 3D models of real-world environments with mobile phones.","tags":["3D Reconstruction","SLAM"],"title":"Turning mobile phones into 3D scanners","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"89d62517c1c327d64b9183e7a6dea1f0","permalink":"https://speciale.com.ar/project/mobile/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/mobile/","section":"project","summary":"  ","tags":["Mobile"],"title":"Mobile","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356994800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356994800,"objectID":"9723547690e3a2bfcc5abe05ad0b6994","permalink":"https://speciale.com.ar/project/phd/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["PhD"],"title":"PhD","type":"project"}]
