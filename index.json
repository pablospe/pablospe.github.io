The recent trend towards cloud-based localization and mapping systems has raised significant privacy concerns. These are mainly grounded by the fact that these services require users to upload visual data to their servers, which can reveal potentially confidential information, even if only derived image features are uploaded. Recent research addresses some of these concerns for the task of image-based localization by concealing the geometry of the query images and database maps. The core idea of the approach is to lift 2D/3D feature points to random lines, while still providing sufficient constraints for camera pose estimation. In this paper, we further build upon this idea and propose solutions to the different core algorithms of an incremental Structure-from-Motion pipeline based on random line features. With this work, we make another fundamental step towards enabling privacy preserving cloud-based mapping solutions. Various experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate the practicality of our approach achieving comparable results to standard Structure-from-Motion systems.","tags":["Privacy Preserving","3D Reconstruction"],"title":"Privacy Preserving Structure-from-Motion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pablo Speciale"],"categories":null,"content":"Geometric constraints on feature points has a long-standing history in 3D Computer Vision among experts. In contrast, we aim to study higher-level primitives other than points – such as lines, planes and ellipsoids – and create novel geometric constraints that allow us to express interesting restrictions and solve new 3D Vision problems. Towards this end, we explore a variety of applications in which we are able to apply geometrical priors using these primitives and find innovative solutions. Thus, we focus on three main components:\n  Lines Constraints. We formulate a new research topic – called the privacy preserving image-based localization problem – and present the first solution by introducing the notion of 3D Line Clouds. It will be shown that this new representation hides the content of the scene and thereby protects user privacy, yet still provides sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation from feature correspondences.\n  Planes Constraints. We introduce a novel geometric constraint using planes as a reflective symmetry prior for variational 3D surface reconstruction. Our method leverages symmetry information directly within a 3D reconstruction procedure in order to complete or denoise symmetric surface regions which have been partially occluded or where the input information has low quality. Opposed to the majority of 3D surface reconstruction methods which fit mini- mal surfaces in order to fill unobserved surface parts, our method favors solutions which align with symmetries and adhere to required smoothness properties at the same time. Similarly to how humans extrapolate occluded areas and 3D information from just a few view points, our method can hallucinate entire scene parts in unobserved areas, fill small holes, or denoise observed surface geometry once a symmetry has been detected.\n  Ellipsoid and LMI Constraints. We propose a general global optimization framework for consensus maximization with Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints. Moreover, we derive several LMI constraints and demonstrate that a number of central computer vision problems can be cast into this form. In particular, we develop a method for the geometric registration of semantically labeled regions. We approximate these semantic regions with ellipsoids, and leverage their convexity to formulate the correspondence search effectively as a constrained global optimization problem that maximizes the number of matched regions. To this end, we also show that ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid assignments can be described as LMI restriction. Our approach is robust to large percentages of outliers and thus applicable to difficult correspondence search problems.\n  For all contributions, we present real and synthetic experiments that validate each method and provide insights into their usefulness w.r.t. the state-of-the-art.\n","date":1566165600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566165600,"objectID":"7366b2426306ebf6eac6ec7955cdd024","permalink":"https://speciale.ar/publication/phd_thesis/","publishdate":"2019-08-19T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/phd_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Geometric constraints on feature points has a long-standing history in 3D Computer Vision among experts.

This raises significant privacy concerns when consumers use such services in their homes or in confidential industrial settings.  Even if only image features are uploaded, the privacy concerns remain as the images can be reconstructed fairly well from feature locations and descriptors. We propose to conceal the content of the query images from an adversary on the server or a man-in-the-middle intruder. The key insight is to replace the 2D image feature points in the query image with randomly oriented 2D lines passing through their original 2D positions. It will be shown that this feature representation hides the image contents, and thereby protects user privacy, yet still provides sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation from feature correspondences. Our proposed method can handle single- and multi-image queries as well as exploit additional information about known structure, gravity, and scale.

Current localization systems rely on the persistent storage of 3D point clouds of the scene to enable camera pose estimation, but such data reveals potentially sensitive scene information. This gives rise to significant privacy risks, especially as for many applications 3D mapping is a background process that the user might not be fully aware of. We pose the following question: How can we avoid disclosing confidential information about the captured 3D scene, and yet allow reliable camera pose estimation? This paper proposes the first solution to what we call privacy preserving image-based localization. The key idea of our approach is to lift the map representation from a 3D point cloud to a 3D line cloud. This novel representation obfuscates the underlying scene geometry while providing sufficient geometric constraints to enable robust and accurate 6-DOF camera pose estimation.

Our approach leverages semantic information, specifically window detections, in multiple scenes to obtain candidate matches from which an alignment hypothesis can be computed.
